	<h1>Understanding HGH (Human Growth Hormone)</h1>
	
	<h2>What is HGH?</h2>

	<h2>Natural Ways to Increase HGH</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Exercise (especially HIIT)</li>
		<li>Quality sleep</li>
		<li>Fasting</li>
		<li>Proper protein intake</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Factors That Decrease HGH</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Sugar consumption</li>
		<li>Poor sleep quality</li>
		<li>High caffeine intake</li>
		<li>Chronic stress</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Important Notes</h2>
	<p>While HGH injections exist, they are not recommended due to potential negative side effects. Instead, focus on natural methods to optimize your body's HGH production.</p>
